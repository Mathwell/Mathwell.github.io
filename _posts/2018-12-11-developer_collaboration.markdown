For the past year I have learned a lot. What trully amazes me is how much I can learn from others. If I have a problem to crash or stuck with some errors simple googling gives me a lot of good options to choose from. I can always ask questions on developers forums and have customized advised from very smart people in no time. 

Slack, and its competitors, such as Microsoft Teams, HipChat/Stride, Zinc or Fleep, are typical conversational glue. They facilitate conversations between all types of groups and individuals.

Github is probably the most popular social coding software around. Every developer knows about it. A free version allows you to create many public repositories, whereas paid versions give you more features, like privacy, etc. Paid versions start from $7/month. 

Other collaborative resourses are: Beanstalk, Jira, Cloud 9, Bitbucket, GitLab, Asana, Float and many many more.

Online collaboration software have been on the rise since the birth of cloud technology. This universal collaboration makes developer's job very productive, efficient and exciting at the same time.
