Writing a code, see it develop from an idea all the way to a functioning and sometimes a useful tool for solving problems, was always very appealing to me. 

Long before I leaned to code, machine programming used to be a women world. However, at the time I went to school to get my MS in Computer Science things change to the opposite. There were almost a hundred persent of male programmers at the market. At least at the place I lived at that time. No one belived in women in that field. Even being an honor student did not increase my chances of landing a decent job. However, I was very persistent and very lucky to find one and enjoy making things better, smoother and faster within one particular small business setting.

Fast forward many years later, after I tried every possible thing to do for living (smilie face), I realized that making things better, smoother and faster using technologies has been always a big part of everything I have done. And another big part was learning. As long as I remember myself I've been always studing, taking classes, taking tests, earnindg gazillions of various certifications and degrees. 

And one day I just realised that there is one profession that combines these all: using various technologies, never-ending learning and developing to the stage of perfection and satisfaction. This in short words outlines how I decided to relearn software development once again in my life with a goal of landing a job of my dream with all inclusive benefits of everything I love to do the most.
