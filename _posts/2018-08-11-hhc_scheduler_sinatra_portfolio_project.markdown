In Home Health Care Industry schedules for medical personnels and aids are the crusial part of work. Each registered nurse visits up to 15 patients a day, aids work 1-2 hours in each client's house and then go to a different home. This is what the main mission of Home Health Care is - to bring help and support to the doors of client's house.

I thought that such scheduler would make a good Sinatra project. 

First I made a plan for desired functionality. My future app supposes to:
1. Keep basic information that distinguishes different users ( first and last names)
2. Secure information with a password uder unique username
3. Keep information about user's client's and visit schedule
4. Allow to add, edit and delete clients
5. Allow edit user's information

The final code works as expected. It implements MVC-pattern. The open source code could be found [here](https://github.com/Mathwell/sinatra-HHC). There is a lot of room for improvement, so contributors are welcome!
