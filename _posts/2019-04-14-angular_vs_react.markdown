***History ***

Angular is a JavaScript framework written in TypeScript. It was developed and is maintained by Google, and is described as a “Superheroic JavaScript MVWFramework” on Angular’s webpage. Angular (version 2 and above), originally released in September 2016, is a complete rewrite of AngularJS (released in October 2010).

React is a JavaScript library developed and maintained by Facebook. It was released in March 2013 and is described as “a JavaScript library for building user interfaces”.

Both Frameworks are available under the MIT license.


***Architecture*** 

*1.	Angular is a framework – React is a library*

Angular is designed as a full-fledged MVC framework that offers strong opinions as to how your application should be structured. However, a drawback is that you have less flexibility – you must use what Angular provides.

React  gives  much more freedom. It only provides the “view” in MVC – you need to solve the M and C on your own. Due to this, you can choose any of your own libraries as you see fit. You will end up using many independent, fast-moving libraries. Because of this, you will need to take care of the corresponding updates and migrations by yourself. In addition, each React project is different and requires a decision requiring its folder hierarchy and architecture. Things can go wrong much more easily due to this.


*2.	Angular uses a regular DOM – React uses a virtual DOM*

React’s use of a virtual DOM is one of its features that makes it so blazingly fast. You’ve probably heard of it. It was React’s “killer feature” when it was first released. 

Angular opted to use a regular DOM. This will update the entire tree structure of HTML tags until it reaches the user’s age.

*3.	Angular uses HTML – React uses JSX*
React decided to combine UI templates and inline JavaScript logic, which no company had ever done before. The result is called “JSX”. JSX is a big advantage for development, because you have everything in one place, and code completion and compile-time checks work better.

Angular uses templates that are enhanced HTML with Angular directives (“ng-if” or “ng-for”). React only requires knowledge of JavaScript, but with Angular, you must learn its specific syntax.

**Testing ** 

Jest is used by Facebook to tests its React code. It is included in every React project and requires zero configuration to use. It also includes a powerful mocking library. Many times Jest is used in combination with Enzyme (a JavaScript testing utility used at Airbnb).
Jasmine is a testing framework that can be used in Angular. Eric Elliott says that Jasmine “results in millions of ways to write tests and assertions, needing to carefully read each one to understand what it’s doing”.

***Conclusion*** 

React and Angular are two titans in a cutthroat industry. In a business where only the strongest survive, you can easily conclude that these are some of the best technologies on the market.
